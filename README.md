# PONG 🏓
This is my implementation of the classic game of pong, using the GLUT library in C++. The game is mostly working, but I'm still fixing some bugs with the collisions in the game.  
Graphics are handled in main.cpp, and the motion of the ball and paddles are calculated in their respective classes.  
Currently the game is 2-player, but I may add an automated opponent in the future.
